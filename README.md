# tictactoe
Tic Tac Toe project idea
Players take turns placing either an X (in the case of Player 1) or an O (for PLayer 2) by typing in the coordinates (treating the top left corner as the origin) corresponding to the location on a three by three grid where they'd like to make their placement. For example, if Player 1 would like to place an X in the top left corner of the grid, they would type 0,0.
